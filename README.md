# fibonacci-methods
his repository contains two Python programs to generate Fibonacci numbers using:

1. **Iterative Method** (`1.Fibonacci series.py`)  
   - Prints the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence  
   - Fast and efficient, suitable for larger values

2. **Recursive Method** (`2.Fibonacci nth term.py`)  
   - Calculates the nth term of the sequence using recursion  
   - Simple to understand but slower for large `n`

##  How to Run

```bash
python "Fibonacci series.py"
python "Fibonacci nth term.py"
